# Moo
A compact library for constructing web application with Go

# Proposal
* Implement as div element. Output as semantic tags.
    * Compare the difference between initial properties and attributes 
    then apply to semamntic tags when output 

# Dropped properties
The common reason that properties go dropped is that 
it requires several linking to see the actual value.

* all
* appearance
* aspect-ratio: controlled by script
* backface-visibility: too advanced at this moment
* break: for printing?
* caption-side: can be handled in more general ways
